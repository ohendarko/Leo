# Play-to-Win Strategic Framework

## The 5 Strategic Choices

### 1. WINNING ASPIRATION
What does winning mean for you?

**Good Example**: "Be the trusted platform for 5M+ Type 2 diabetes patients"
**Bad Example**: "Disrupt healthcare"

### 2. WHERE TO PLAY
Which specific markets will you compete in?

**Dimensions:**
- Customer segment (which specific patient/provider group?)
- Geography (which regions first?)
- Product scope (which conditions/workflows?)
- Distribution channel (D2C, B2B, B2G?)

**Good Example**: "Remote monitoring for post-discharge Medicare heart failure patients in US"
**Bad Example**: "Digital health solutions globally"

### 3. HOW TO WIN
What is your competitive advantage?

**Sources of Advantage:**
- Clinical: Superior outcomes with evidence
- Technology: Proprietary data/algorithms
- Distribution: Exclusive partnerships
- Economic: Demonstrable ROI
- Regulatory: FDA clearance barrier

**Red Flags:**
- "We'll execute better" (not defensible)
- No moat beyond being first
- Easily copied advantage

### 4. CORE CAPABILITIES
What must you be great at?

**HealthTech Capabilities:**
- Clinical validation
- Regulatory navigation
- Behavior change design
- Data science
- Healthcare sales (complex B2B)
- EHR integration
- Payer contracting

**Red Flags:**
- Capabilities don't match team
- Trying to build too many in-house
- Missing critical regulatory expertise

### 5. MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
What systems support your strategy?

**Key Areas:**
- Metrics (clinical, business, operational)
- Resource allocation
- Culture and incentives
- Governance

## Strategic Coherence Test
All 5 choices must reinforce each other:
1. Do capabilities enable how-to-win?
2. Does how-to-win work in where-to-play?
3. Does where-to-play achieve winning aspiration?
4. Do systems support capabilities?

## HealthTech Strategic Traps
1. "Better product" fallacy (distribution matters more)
2. "Everyone is a customer" trap (pick one primary)
3. "Data moat" illusion (data must drive outcomes)
4. "Regulatory arbitrage" risk (gray areas are risky)
5. "Pivot too late" problem (test and adjust early)
