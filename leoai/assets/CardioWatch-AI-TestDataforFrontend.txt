AI-powered cardiac monitoring for heart failure patients
Problem Statement
Heart failure readmissions cost Medicare $17B annually, with 30-day readmission rates at 25%. The primary issue is lack of early detection of patient deterioration between clinic visits. Current remote monitoring solutions have poor adherence rates (40-60%) among elderly patients and fail to predict clinical events with sufficient lead time for intervention. Healthcare systems lose money on readmissions under value-based care models, creating strong financial incentive to prevent them.
Solution
CardioWatch AI is a wearable device combined with AI algorithms that continuously analyze ECG patterns, heart rate variability, and activity levels to predict clinical deterioration 48 hours before an event occurs. The system integrates with hospital EHRs and alerts both patients and care teams when intervention is needed. Our proprietary machine learning model has been trained on 50,000+ patient-hours of cardiac data and validated in a pilot study showing 92% accuracy in predicting deterioration events.
Target Market
Post-discharge Medicare heart failure patients in the United States, initially focusing on partnerships with Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) that have financial risk for readmissions. Our beachhead market is ACOs in the Northeast with 500+ heart failure patients under management. Secondary targets include Medicare Advantage plans and large cardiology practices participating in value-based care contracts.
Competitive Advantage
Our proprietary ECG interpretation algorithm achieves 92% accuracy in predicting deterioration events, validated in a pilot with 150 patients across 3 hospital systems (Massachusetts General, Cleveland Clinic, Mayo). Unlike competitors who focus on simple vital sign monitoring, our AI analyzes subtle ECG pattern changes that precede clinical symptoms. We have preliminary data showing our predictions occur an average of 48 hours before ER visits, compared to 12-24 hours for existing solutions. Additionally, our device design specifically addresses elderly adoption barriers with one-button operation and 7-day battery life.

Funding Goal
$2M seed round for FDA 510(k) submission and multi-site clinical trial
Additional Context
We completed a 6-month pilot with 150 patients across 3 health systems, achieving 85% device adherence after the first month (vs. industry average of 40-60%). We have letters of intent from 2 ACOs representing 5,000 heart failure patients, pending clinical validation. Our founding team includes a cardiologist (former Chief of Cardiology at Mass General), a machine learning PhD from MIT, and a former Medtronic executive. We've identified the Zephyr BioPatch as our FDA 510(k) predicate device and have had preliminary discussions with the FDA about our regulatory pathway.

Expected Questions (After Interrogation)
Based on previous tests, Leo should generate questions like:
Q1 (NASSS - Adoption Risk):
"Your target users are Medicare heart failure patients, typically 65+ with multiple comorbidities and often limited digital literacy - what specific user research have you conducted on device adoption barriers in this population, and what is your concrete strategy for overcoming the 40-60% non-adherence rates typical in remote monitoring for elderly patients?"
Q2 (Play-to-Win - Competitive Advantage):
"Your 92% accuracy claim from 150 patients across 3 hospitals - what was your primary endpoint, control group, and statistical power calculation, and how do you plan to demonstrate clinical utility (actual reduction in readmissions, not just prediction accuracy) required for FDA 510(k) approval and payer confidence?"
Q3 (Business Model - Revenue):
"ACOs need clear ROI to justify new technology spend - what specific CPT codes will enable reimbursement, what is your per-patient-per-month pricing model, and how have you validated that ACOs have budget authority and willingness to pay this amount given their existing remote monitoring contracts?"

Sample Answers (For Testing Full Flow)
Answer to Q1:
We conducted user interviews with 25 heart failure patients (average age 72) and 10 family caregivers to understand adoption barriers. Key findings: 70% were open to wearables if setup was handled by clinical staff, and 85% wanted family members to receive alerts. Our mitigation strategy includes: (1) White-glove onboarding with in-home setup by nurses, (2) 24/7 phone support line with human escalation for technical issues, (3) Simplified device with one-button operation and no smartphone requirement, (4) Family caregiver app for remote monitoring. In our 6-month pilot, we achieved 85% adherence (6+ days/week wear) after month 1, significantly above the 40-60% industry baseline. Key success factor was the nurse home visit for initial setup and training.
Answer to Q2:
Our pilot's primary endpoint was 48-hour advance prediction of clinical deterioration events, defined as unplanned ER visits or hospital readmissions for heart failure exacerbation. We acknowledge the study was observational with no formal control group—we compared our AI predictions to actual outcomes retrospectively. The 92% accuracy represents sensitivity in detecting deterioration events before they occurred. We recognize this is insufficient for FDA approval. Our go-forward plan: (1) $1.5M funded randomized controlled trial with 500 patients over 18 months, with intervention group receiving CardioWatch alerts vs. control group with standard care, measuring 30-day readmission reduction as primary endpoint. (2) We've identified Zephyr BioPatch as our 510(k) predicate device. (3) Target FDA submission Q4 2026. We're also planning a health economics study to quantify cost savings per avoided readmission.
Answer to Q3:
We're targeting CPT codes 99457 and 99458 (Remote Physiologic Monitoring - Treatment Management Services), which currently reimburse approximately $50-60 per patient per month when criteria are met (20+ minutes of provider time). Our pricing model is $75 PMPM to ACOs, leaving us $15-25 margin after device costs, cloud infrastructure, and support. We've had preliminary budget discussions with 2 ACOs (combined 5,000 HF patients) who confirmed they have dedicated RPM budgets and current contracts with competitors at similar price points. However, they require clinical validation showing actual readmission reduction before commitment. Our key concern: CMS recently proposed changes to RPM codes that could reduce reimbursement by 20-30% in 2026, which would compress our already thin margins. We're exploring alternative revenue models including risk-sharing arrangements where we take a percentage of avoided readmission savings.
