What about the pilot validation?\n4. **Core Capabilities**: Need to understand if they have regulatory expertise, clinical validation capabilities\n5. **Management Systems**: No mention of metrics, governance\n\n**Business Model Canvas:**\n1. **Customer Segments**: ACOs mentioned but who exactly pays?\n2. **Value Proposition**: Cost savings mentioned but not quantified for payers\n3. **Channels**: ACO partnerships - but how do they reach ACOs?\n4. **Revenue Streams**: No mention of pricing model or reimbursement strategy\n5. **Key Resources**: Algorithm mentioned, but what about regulatory, clinical validation?\n6. **Cost Structure**: $2M mentioned but no unit economics\n\n**Regulatory Framework:**\n1. **FDA**: 510(k) mentioned but no predicate device identified\n2. **Clinical Evidence**: 150 patients across 3 hospitals - is this sufficient for FDA? What about RCTs?\n\n\n3. **Reimbursement**: No CPT code strategy mentioned\n\nI see three critical gaps that pose significant strategic risks. First, the Medicare patient adoption strategy is fundamentally flawed. The elderly population's low digital literacy creates a massive barrier to technology acceptance. Without a comprehensive user support and digital inclusion plan, the product could fail before gaining traction.\n\nSecond, the clinical validation appears weak. A 150-patient pilot with a 92% accuracy claim lacks the robust evidence needed for FDA approval and meaningful clinical utility. The small sample size and undefined methodology undermine their core competitive advantage.\n\nThird, the business model lacks financial clarity. No clear reimbursement pathway, pricing strategy, or revenue model exists, leaving fundamental questions about economic viability unanswered.\n\nThese systemic gaps suggest the solution requires radical rethinking across patient adoption, clinical validation, and financial sustainability."},"timestamp":"2025-11-19T21:55:44.240Z"}
